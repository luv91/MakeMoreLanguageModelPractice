1. Braodcasting

2. Likelihood : product of the proabbilities

3. simple bigram model training. simmply generate probabilities of the count of bigrams

4. log probabilities are negative. 

5. Goal, maximize likelihood of the data w.r.t model parameters (statistical modelling)
	--> equivalent to maximizing the log likelihood
	--> equivalent to minimizing the negative log likelihood
	--> equivalent to minimizing the average negative log likelihood
